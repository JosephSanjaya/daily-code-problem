We define a function findFixedPoint that takes an integer array arr as input and returns either the index of the first fixed point found, or false if no fixed point exists in the array.

We initialize two variables low and high that represent the range of indices we will search for a fixed point. low is initially set to 0 (the first index of the array) and high is set to arr.size - 1 (the last index of the array).

We enter a while loop that continues until low is greater than high, indicating that we've exhausted the search space and haven't found a fixed point.

In each iteration of the loop, we calculate the middle index mid by taking the average of low and high (rounded down to an integer using integer division).

We then compare the value at arr[mid] to the index mid. If they are equal, we've found a fixed point and return it.

If arr[mid] is less than mid, we know that any fixed point must be to the right of mid, since the array is sorted and any value to the left of mid would also be less than its index. We update low to mid + 1 to narrow our search to the right half of the array.

If arr[mid] is greater than mid, we know that any fixed point must be to the left of mid, since any value to the right of mid would also be greater than its index. We update high to mid - 1 to narrow our search to the left half of the array.

If we haven't found a fixed point by the end of the loop, we return false.
